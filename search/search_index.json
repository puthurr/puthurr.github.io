If you look at our Simple page layout , the middle block of text is a 2 column layout: you will read the first column then continue to the next column naturally without event thinking about it. Well this is this natural reading order of things in a page, our default sorting algorythm tries to emulate. The implementation is done in the method named BBoxSort.contoursSort(...) Default sorting Algorithm \u00b6 It is the best algo I could came up with so far. Let me go through it a bit. Ultimate Goal : Generate a blockid for each block of text which we can sort upon, matching a certain natural reading order. To generate a blockid I need first to understand where the blocks stands. Inspired by the following stackoverflow answer contributed by J-D , the default sorting algo implements the following tasks First round: Vertical grouping \u00b6 Find regions on the Y axis separated by empty regions: - Empty region is a region on the Y axis where there is no bounding boxes - By opposite we can then find regions on the Y Axis containing existing boxes See how blocks of text are grouped vertically like in the stackoverflow answer. For each non-empty region, - ascending sort on their opposite axis - add a sequence number to each belonging block + regularization value I then repeat the same operation horizontally so I can handle the 2-columns of text locating on the same vertical group. Second round: Horizontal grouping \u00b6 Find regions on the X axis separated by empty regions: - Empty region is a region on the X axis where there is no bounding boxes - By opposite we can then find regions on the X Axis containing existing boxes For each non-empty region, - ascending sort on their opposite axis - add a sequence number to each belonging block + regularization value At the end, each block has a blockid which we can sort ascendantly. This isn't perfect by all means, I'll be happy to receive feedback on this or welcome contributors to enhance this algorithm. Others sorting algorithms \u00b6 I'm providing few other \"simplier\" examples of sorting algorythm for convenience. Check the BBoxSort class in bboxutils.py .

It is common for investment in the field to continue during production, either through the drilling of more development wells or construction of new facilities. Following development of wells and facilities, the field will reach first production. Oil and gas are then produced and transported ashore via a network of subsea pipelines, or in some cases for oil via tankers. Gas is typically treated onshore at processing plants, providing the primary fuel for heating or sent to power plants for conversion into electricity. Most all is converted into petroleum products such as feedstock and fuel for transport or other industrial use. 6-15 years Decommissioning Once the reservoir of a field is sufficiently depleted to the extent that no further reserves can be economically recovered, the field will cease production.

This study is made possible through the use of state-of-the-art technique of gas chromatography / mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry or GCMSMS to provide highly selective measurements of biomarkers which are typically in low concentrations in source rock extracts, oils, and especially in condensates. Since only one well dataset is available, only the vertical variation in the source rock quality of the lacustrine shales is discussed. Stratigraphically, there is a noticeable change in the source rock quality within the three groups. In general, the TOC content of the lacustrine shale sequences in Groups K, L and M range from 0.35 to 2.00 wt%. Kerogen composition of these shales varies, showing mixtures of Type I to Type III indicating variable contributions from algal, bacterial and higher plant organic matter deposited in highly to less oxidising environments. This is indicated by hydrogen index (HI) values ranging from 137 to 403. Group L lacustrine shales provide the best oil-prone source rock with TOC values of 0.45 to 1.95 wt% and HI values in the range of 300 to 400 indicating predominantly Type II kerogens. The variation in the source rock quality within the Groups K, L and M may be due to a combination of organic source input and factors controlling the preservation of organic matter within the environments of deposition. This observation is supported by data from screening and microscopic analyses of whole rocks and alkane and biomarker analyses of source rock extracts. It appears that Groups L and M shales, deposited in a lacustrine environment, received more algal input compared to terrigenous organic matter in a less oxic condition resulting in relatively better organic matter preservation. This is shown by the lower Pr/Ph ratio in the range of 3.1 to 4.0, lower Im/Ts ratio, moderate to high abundance of C30-diahopame and low abundance of tricyclics and gammacerane. On the other hand, the younger Group K had more fluvial influence and consequently received relatively more terrigenous organic matter input being deposited in a more oxidising environment. This is indicated by the higher Pr/Ph ratio (5.1 to 6.2), higher abundance of oleanane, predominance of C:29-sterames compared to C27- and C28-steranes, and trace amounts of tricyclics and gammacerame. It is also observed microscopically that Group K has higher abundance of terrigenous-derived vitrinite particles available for measurements as opposed to Groups L and M.

Fluviodeltaic source rocks, on the other hand, found mainly in the Lower-Middle Miocene I and E groups are mainly made up of coastal plain shales and coal carbonaceous shales. This paper is partly the result of a study carried out by PETRONAS to determine the source facies of the recently discovered oils in the basement rocks within the Anding Utara area. The aim of this paper is to discuss the vertical variation in source rock quality of the lacustrine shales in Groups K, L and M. For this purpose, Anding Barat Laut-1 (ABL-1) was selected as it is stratigraphically the deepest well within the study area (Figure 1).

This study is made possible through the use of state-of-the-art technique of gas chromatography / mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry or GCMSMS to provide highly selective measurements of biomarkers which are typically in low concentrations in source rock extracts, oils, and especially in condensates. Since only one well dataset is available, only the vertical variation in the source rock quality of the lacustrine shales is discussed. Stratigraphically, there is a noticeable change in the source rock quality within the three groups. In general, the TOC content of the lacustrine shale sequences in Groups K, L and M range from 0.35 to 2.00 wt%. Kerogen composition of these shales varies, showing mixtures of Type I to Type II indicating variable contributions from algal, bacterial and higher plant organic matter deposited in highly to less oxidising environments. This is indicated by hydrogen index (HI) values ranging from 137 to 403. Group L lacustrine shales provide the best oil-prone source rock with TOC values of 0.45 to 1.95 wt% and HI values in the range of 300 to 400 indicating predominantly Type I kerogens. The variation in the source rock quality within the Groups K, L and M may be due to a combination of organic source input and factors controlling the preservation of organic matter within the environments of deposition. This observation is supported by data from screening and microscopic analyses of whole rocks and alkane and biomarker analyses of source rock extracts. It appears that Groups L and M shales, deposited in a lacustrine environment, received more algal input compared to terrigenous organic matter in a less oxic condition resulting in relatively better organic matter preservation. This is shown by the lower Pr/Ph ratio in the range of 3.1 to 4.0, lower Tm Ts ratio, moderate to high abundance of C30-diabopane and low abundance of tricyclics and gammacerane. On the other hand, the younger Group K had more fluvial influence and consequently received relatively more terrigenous organic matter input being deposited in a more oxidising environment This is indicated by the higher Pr/Ph ratio (5.1 to 6.2), higher abundance of oleanane, predominance of C29-steranes compared to C27- and C28-steranes, and trace amounts of tricyclics and gammacerane. It is also observed microscopically that Group K has higher abundance of terrigenous-derived vitrinite particles available for measurements as opposed to Groups L and M. The marked change in organic facies within the lacustrine shales from Groups L and M to Group K is reflected in the evolution of the Malay Basin i.e. the transition from syurift to post-rift phase during the L and early part of Keywords: Malay basin, source rock quality, organic facies, lacustrine sbale INTRODUCTION It has been well documented that the oils and condensates of the Malay Basin are being generated by two main source rocks - lacustrine and fluviodeltaic, with varying degrees of mixing between them (EPIC, 1994; McCaffrey et al., 1998). However, a recent study on the petroleum systems of the northern part of the Malay Basin has also shown that fluvial marine source rocks could also generate these oils (Madon et al., 2006). The gradual change from lacustrine, through parallic and fluviodeltaic, to open marine in the source rock successions reflects the sedimentary evolution of the basin. The lacustrine source rocks, consisting of shales, occur in the Oligocene/Early Miocene K, L, and M groups. Fluviodeltaic source rocks, on the other hand, found mainly in the Lower-Middle Miocene I and E groups are mainly made up of coastal plain shales and coal/carbonaceous shales. This paper is partly the result of a study carried out by PETRONAS to determine the source facies of the recently discovered oils in the basement rocks within the Anding Utara area. The aim of this paper is to discuss the vertical variation in source rock quality of the lacustrine shales in Groups K, L and M. For this purpose. Anding Barat Laut-1 ABL-1) was selected as it is stratigraphically the deepest well within the study area (Figure 1). Lacustrine shales have been recognised as perhaps the single most oil-prone facies, especially in the Southeast Asian Tertiary basins (Cole & Crittenden, 1997). In the Malay Basin, it has been widely accepted that lacustrine shales are closely associated with the sediments of Groups K, L and M (Figure 2). The oldest lacustrine source rocks (Group M) were deposited in isolated half-grabens during the synrift phase where sedimentation took place during the extentional phase of basin development, occurring as half-graben fills. The transition between the synrift and post-rift occured during the L and early part of K times. Although the lakes were perhaps small initially, they may have evolved into larger lakes as the basin subsided rapidly.
