The callocr flag means we will invoke the online OCR service to process an image.

If you only interested in testing a single OCR Engine, simply comment out the function prefix by either google_ or axure_ in bboxtester.py. The code detect automatically which function to run based on its signature. Sample script flow \u00b6 process one or all images located under the images script (one level of the python dir), call the corresponding OCR service, persist the raw ocr response on disk in the tests-results or the directory of your choice persist the original image with the bouding boxes of the raw OCR response call on the BBOx Helper processOCRResponse() method. persist the original image with the bouding boxes of the BBoxHelper OCR response .

If you look at our Simple page layout , the middle block of text is a 2 column layout: you will read the first column then continue to the next column naturally without event thinking about it. Well this is this natural reading order of things in a page, our default sorting algorythm tries to emulate. The implementation is done in the method named BBoxSort.contoursSort(...) Default sorting Algorithm \u00b6 It is the best algo I could came up with so far. Let me go through it a bit. Ultimate Goal : Generate a rank for each block of text which we can sort upon, matching a certain natural reading order. To generate a rank scoe, we need first to understand where the blocks stands. Inspired by the following stackoverflow answer contributed by J-D , the default sorting algo implements the following tasks First round: Vertical grouping \u00b6 Find regions on the Y axis separated by empty regions: - Empty region is a region on the Y axis where there is no bounding boxes - By opposite we can then find regions on the Y Axis containing existing boxes See how blocks of text are grouped vertically like in the stackoverflow answer. For each non-empty region, - ascending sort on their opposite axis - add a sequence number to each belonging block + regularization value I then repeat the same operation horizontally so I can handle the 2-columns of text locating on the same vertical group. Second round: Horizontal grouping \u00b6 Find regions on the X axis separated by empty regions: - Empty region is a region on the X axis where there is no bounding boxes - By opposite we can then find regions on the X Axis containing existing boxes For each non-empty region, - ascending sort on their opposite axis - add a sequence number to each belonging block + regularization value At the end, each block has a rank which we can sort ascendantly. This isn't perfect by all means, I'll be happy to receive feedback on this or welcome contributors to enhance this algorithm. Others sorting algorithms \u00b6 I'm providing few other \"simplier\" examples of sorting algorythm for convenience. Check the BBoxSort class in bboxutils.py .

Given that most of the UK's oil and gas is offshore, seismic surveying vessels are used to help identify where oil and gas may be present. This enables oil and gas companies to target areas to explore. Once a licence has been obtained, the next step is to drill an exploration well to determine whether hydrocarbons are present. This process typically assesses everything from facilities design to operating models and decommissioning. Once finalised, a Field Development Plan (FDP) is submitted to the Oil and Gas Authority for consideration and, when approved, development can begin. If successfully explored and appraised, the partners will consider a range of development concepts.

Oil and gas are then produced and transported ashore via a network of subsea pipelines, or in some cases for oil via tankers. It is common for investment in the field to continue during production, either through the drilling of more development wells or construction of new facilities. AVANA Gas is typically treated onshore at processing plants, providing the primary fuel for heating or sent to power plants for conversion into electricity. Most oll is converted into petroleum products such as feedstock and fuel for transport or other industrial use. 6-15 years Decommissioning Once the reservoir of a field is sufficiently depleted to the extent that no further reserves can be economically recovered, the field will cease production. Companies are legally required to decommission assets once they have ceased production, which the Oil and Gas Authority estimates will cost around \u00a360 billion (in 2016 money). This process includes plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal of topsides, platforms, certain pipelines and subsea equipment. Processed gas enters the National Transmission System, or in some cases, components are stripped out and used as chemical feedstocks.

This enables oil and gas companies to target areas to explore. The UK Government auctions off licences to prospective bidders, enabling exploration to take place. Once a licence has been obtained, the next step is to drill an exploration well to determine whether hydrocarbons are present.

Oil and gas will play a very important role in the The stage is set for gas to become the world's energy mix throughout our forecasting period. Although we expect renewable energy sources to primary energy source towards 2050, and the last of take an increasing share of this mix, we forecast oil the fossil fuels to experience peak demand, which and gas to account for 44% of the world's primary will occur in 2035 according to our model. Gas can play a central role in supporting energy security energy supply in 2050, down from 53% today. Investment will be needed to add new oil and gas alongside variable renewables during the transition. production capacity, and to operate existing assets There are opportunities to improve its carbon footprint by curtailing methane emissions from its safely and sustainably over this period, to deliver output levels that can meet predicted demand. value chain and through improving the economics of large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) for gas-fuelled power generation.

Lot 3288 & 3289, Kawasan Institusi Bangi, 43000 Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia \"Email address: jalilmu@petronas.com.my Abstract - This paper discusses the source rock quality of the lacustrine shales within Groups K, L and M in the southern flank of the Malay Basin. This study is made possible through the use of state-of-the-art technique of gas chromatography / mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry or GCMSMS to provide highly selective measurements of biomarkers which are typically in low concentrations in source rock extracts, oils, and especially in condensates. Since only one well dataset is available, only the vertical variation in the source rock quality of the lacustrine shales is discussed. Stratigraphically, there is a noticeable change in the source rock quality within the three groups. In general, the TOC content of the lacustrine shale sequences in Groups K, L and M range from 0.35 to 2.00 wt%. Kerogen composition of these shales varies, showing mixtures of Type I to Type III indicating variable contributions from algal, bacterial and higher plant organic matter deposited in highly to less oxidising environments. This is indicated by hydrogen index (HI) values ranging from 137 to 403. Group L lacustrine shales provide the best oil-prone source rock with TOC values of 0.45 to 1.95 wt% and HI values in the range of 300 to 400 indicating predominantly Type II kerogens. The variation in the source rock quality within the Groups K, L and M may be due to a combination of organic source input and factors controlling the preservation of organic matter within the environments of deposition. This observation is supported by data from screening and microscopic analyses of whole rocks and alkane and biomarker analyses of source rock extracts. It appears that Groups L and M shales, deposited in a lacustrine environment, received more algal input compared to terrigenous organic matter in a less oxic condition resulting in relatively better organic matter preservation. This is shown by the lower Pr/Ph ratio in the range of 3.1 to 4.0, lower Im/Ts ratio, moderate to high abundance of C30-diahopame and low abundance of tricyclics and gammacerane. On the other hand, the younger Group K had more fluvial influence and consequently received relatively more terrigenous organic matter input being deposited in a more oxidising environment. This is indicated by the higher Pr/Ph ratio (5.1 to 6.2), higher abundance of oleanane, predominance of C:29-sterames compared to C27- and C28-steranes, and trace amounts of tricyclics and gammacerame. It is also observed microscopically that Group K has higher abundance of terrigenous-derived vitrinite particles available for measurements as opposed to Groups L and M.

Keywords: Malay basin, source rock quality, organic facies, lacustrine shale INTRODUCTION It has been well documented that the oils and condensates of the Malay Basin are being generated by two main source rocks - lacustrine and fluviodeltaic, with varying degrees of mixing between them (EPIC, 1994; Mccaffrey et al., 1998). However, a recent study on the petroleum systems of the northern part of the Malay Basin has also shown that fluvial marine source rocks could also generate these oils (Madon et al., 2006). The gradual change from lacustrine, through parallic and fluviodeltaic, to open marine in the source rock successions reflects the sedimentary evolution of the basin. The lacustrine source rocks, consisting of shales, occur in the Oligocene/Early Miocene K, L, and M groups. Fluviodeltaic source rocks, on the other hand, found mainly in the Lower-Middle Miocene I and E groups are mainly made up of coastal plain shales and coal carbonaceous shales. This paper is partly the result of a study carried out by PETRONAS to determine the source facies of the recently discovered oils in the basement rocks within the Anding Utara area. The aim of this paper is to discuss the vertical variation in source rock quality of the lacustrine shales in Groups K, L and M. For this purpose, Anding Barat Laut-1 (ABL-1) was selected as it is stratigraphically the deepest well within the study area (Figure 1). Lacustrine shales have been recognised as perhaps the single most oil-prone facies, especially in the Southeast Asian Tertiary basins (Cole & Crittenden, 1997). In the Malay Basin, it has been widely accepted that lacustrine shales are closely associated with the sediments of Groups K, L and M (Figure 2). The oldest lacustrine source rocks (Group M) were deposited in isolated half-grabens during the synrift phase where sedimentation took place during the extentional phase of basin development, occuring as half-graben fills. The transition between the synrift and post-rift occurred during the L and early part of K times. Although the lakes were perhaps small initially, they may have evolved into larger lakes as the basin subsided rapidly.

This study is made possible through the use of state-of-the-art technique of gas chromatography / mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry or GCMSMS to provide highly selective measurements of biomarkers which are typically in low concentrations in source rock extracts, oils, and especially in condensates. Since only one well dataset is available, only the vertical variation in the source rock quality of the lacustrine shales is discussed. Stratigraphically, there is a noticeable change in the source rock quality within the three groups. In general, the TOC content of the lacustrine shale sequences in Groups K, L and M range from 0.35 to 2.00 wt%. Kerogen composition of these shales varies, showing mixtures of Type I to Type II indicating variable contributions from algal, bacterial and higher plant organic matter deposited in highly to less oxidising environments. This is indicated by hydrogen index (HI) values ranging from 137 to 403. Group L lacustrine shales provide the best oil-prone source rock with TOC values of 0.45 to 1.95 wt% and HI values in the range of 300 to 400 indicating predominantly Type I kerogens. The variation in the source rock quality within the Groups K, L and M may be due to a combination of organic source input and factors controlling the preservation of organic matter within the environments of deposition. This observation is supported by data from screening and microscopic analyses of whole rocks and alkane and biomarker analyses of source rock extracts. It appears that Groups L and M shales, deposited in a lacustrine environment, received more algal input compared to terrigenous organic matter in a less oxic condition resulting in relatively better organic matter preservation. This is shown by the lower Pr/Ph ratio in the range of 3.1 to 4.0, lower Tm Ts ratio, moderate to high abundance of C30-diabopane and low abundance of tricyclics and gammacerane. On the other hand, the younger Group K had more fluvial influence and consequently received relatively more terrigenous organic matter input being deposited in a more oxidising environment This is indicated by the higher Pr/Ph ratio (5.1 to 6.2), higher abundance of oleanane, predominance of C29-steranes compared to C27- and C28-steranes, and trace amounts of tricyclics and gammacerane. It is also observed microscopically that Group K has higher abundance of terrigenous-derived vitrinite particles available for measurements as opposed to Groups L and M. The marked change in organic facies within the lacustrine shales from Groups L and M to Group K is reflected in the evolution of the Malay Basin i.e. the transition from syurift to post-rift phase during the L and early part of times.

For this purpose, Anding Barat Laut-1 (ABL-1) was selected as it is stratigraphically the deepest well within the study area (Figure 1). Lacustrine shales have been recognised as perhaps the single most oil-prone facies, especially in the Southeast Asian Tertiary basins (Cole & Crittenden, 1997). In the Malay Basin, it has been widely accepted that lacustrine shales are closely associated with the sediments of Groups K, L and M (Figure 2). The oldest lacustrine source rocks (Group M) were deposited in isolated half-grabens during the synrift phase where sedimentation took place during the extentional phase of basin development, occuring as half-graben fills. The transition between the synrift and post-rift occurred during the L and early part of K times. Although the lakes were perhaps small initially, they may have evolved into larger lakes as the basin subsided rapidly.

This study is made possible through the use of state-of-the-art technique of gas chromatography / mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry or GCMSMS to provide highly selective measurements of biomarkers which are typically in low concentrations in source rock extracts, oils, and especially in condensates. Since only one well dataset is available, only the vertical variation in the source rock quality of the lacustrine shales is discussed. Stratigraphically, there is a noticeable change in the source rock quality within the three groups. In general, the TOC content of the lacustrine shale sequences in Groups K, L and M range from 0.35 to 2.00 wt%. Kerogen composition of these shales varies, showing mixtures of Type I to Type II indicating variable contributions from algal, bacterial and higher plant organic matter deposited in highly to less oxidising environments. This is indicated by hydrogen index (HI) values ranging from 137 to 403. Group L lacustrine shales provide the best oil-prone source rock with TOC values of 0.45 to 1.95 wt% and HI values in the range of 300 to 400 indicating predominantly Type I kerogens. The variation in the source rock quality within the Groups K, L and M may be due to a combination of organic source input and factors controlling the preservation of organic matter within the environments of deposition. This observation is supported by data from screening and microscopic analyses of whole rocks and alkane and biomarker analyses of source rock extracts. It appears that Groups L and M shales, deposited in a lacustrine environment, received more algal input compared to terrigenous organic matter in a less oxic condition resulting in relatively better organic matter preservation. This is shown by the lower Pr/Ph ratio in the range of 3.1 to 4.0, lower Tm Ts ratio, moderate to high abundance of C30-diabopane and low abundance of tricyclics and gammacerane. On the other hand, the younger Group K had more fluvial influence and consequently received relatively more terrigenous organic matter input being deposited in a more oxidising environment This is indicated by the higher Pr/Ph ratio (5.1 to 6.2), higher abundance of oleanane, predominance of C29-steranes compared to C27- and C28-steranes, and trace amounts of tricyclics and gammacerane. It is also observed microscopically that Group K has higher abundance of terrigenous-derived vitrinite particles available for measurements as opposed to Groups L and M. The marked change in organic facies within the lacustrine shales from Groups L and M to Group K is reflected in the evolution of the Malay Basin i.e. the transition from syurift to post-rift phase during the L and early part of times.
